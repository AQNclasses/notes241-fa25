# Hash maps

AKA "dictionaries"

Key-value pairs: the **key** is *hashed* to find the location of the **value**.

What is hashing? (a mathematical function)

What properties should hash function have?

- map arbitrary sized input data to fixed-size representation (array index)
- example: integers + identity function
- example: integers + mod 10

Mathematically, hash maps implement a **set**.

What problems do we have to solve while implementing a hash function?

- collisions
- full table

how to solve?
