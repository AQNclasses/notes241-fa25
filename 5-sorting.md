# Sorting

We saw binary search was very efficient for a sorted array. But how to get a
sorted array?

## Comparison-Based Sorting

- bubble sort
- merge sort
- quicksort

Java details:
- `implements Comparable` required
- What about objects with multiple fields?
- Can create a `Comparator` to pass to `sort`: tells sort what part of the
object to look at

## Non-comparative sorting

- radix sort
