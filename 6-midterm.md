# Midterm Info and Review

The midterm will be held in lab during the week of November 3. The exam will be
designed to take 50 minutes, but you have the whole lab time.

There will be a coding component in the midterm. You will have access to VSCode
(without CoPilot) and Eclipse for text editors. You may reference the Java Docs but no other online resources.

If you plan to take exam in the DAC, contact me to schedule a time to complete your coding portion (the DAC cannot support our coding environment). You will complete the coding portion in my office; you can complete the rest of the exam in the DAC or in my office.

We will hold an in-class review session on Friday, October 31. Bring questions.

You are allowed a note sheet: you may type or hand-write notes on **one side** of an 8.5"x11" piece of paper.
